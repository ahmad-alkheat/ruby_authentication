I have used Devise, Warden and many other gems to authenticate users in a Rails app, but without really understanding what's really going on under the hood. So I started this project to implement each type of authentication manually. Types of authentication implemented:
1-HTTP authentication
2-Cookie-based authentication
3-Token authentication
4-OAuth authentication with GitHub
